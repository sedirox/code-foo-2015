In order to find out the number of ping-pong balls that’ll fit in a 747, we’ll need to split the plane up into different parts and find the number of ping pong balls that’ll fit into each part:

Cockpit
Cargo hold
Overhead baggage area
Main cabin+Upper cabin: General passenger volume

Assume the ping-pong ball has a radius of 4cm. The volume of 1 ball would be
 V = (4/3)pi(r^3) where r is the radius at 4cm, giving us a volume of approximately 268.1 cm^3

Using this,we can find the number of ping-pong balls that will fit into each part of a 747 with the formula

Number of ping-pong balls = volume of component/ volume of ping-pong ball
(Making sure the units are the same)

Finally, we add all the parts together to get an approximate to the number of ping-pong balls that’ll fit in a 747.

Cargo hold: 4546ft^3
Changing the units of one ping pong ball from cm^3 to ft^3 we get 0.0095ft^3
4546/0.0095 is approximately 478,526 ping pong balls.

Cockpit: 1680ft^3
1680/0.0095 is approximately 176,842 ping pong balls

Main cabin + upper cabin: 26600ft^3
26600/0.0095 is approximately 2,800,000 ping pong balls.

Overhead baggage area: 1200ft^3
1200/0.0095 is approximately 126,315 ping pong balls

Now we add up all the numbers to get the total number of ping pong balls that’ll fit in a 747

478526+176842+2800000+126315 = 3,581,682 ping pong balls

Therefore, about 3,581,682 ping pong balls would be needed to fill a 747.
